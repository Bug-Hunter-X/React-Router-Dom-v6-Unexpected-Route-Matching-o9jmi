This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6: unexpected route matching or page not found errors. The problem arises from incorrect route configuration, potentially leading to the wrong component being rendered or the wildcard route failing to catch unmatched paths.  The solution involves carefully reviewing the route definitions and ensuring correct path specifications and component assignments.  The solution file demonstrates how to properly configure the routes and handle potential issues.
